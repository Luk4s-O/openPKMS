Functions f and g are inverses if $f(g(x))=x=g(f(x))$. For every pair of such functions, the derivatives $f'$ and $g'$ have a special relationship.

If the function $f$ has an [[inverse function]] $g$, meaning that $g(f(x)) = x$ and $f(g(y)) = y,$ then:
$$g = \frac{1}{f\circ g}$$

In Leibniz notation, this is written as
$$\frac{dx}{dy} = \frac{1}{\frac{dy}{dx}}$$
or
$$\dfrac{dy}{dx}=\dfrac{d}{dx}(f^{−1}(x))=(f^{−1})'(x)=\dfrac{1}{f'(f^{−1}(x))}\label{inverse1}$$
