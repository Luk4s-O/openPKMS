- Enables substantial amplification of an input signal
When an operational amplifier is combined with an amplification circuit, it can amplify weak signals to strong signals.It behaves like a megaphone where the input signal is a personâ€™s voice and the megaphone is the operational amplifier circuit.For example, such a circuit can be used to amplify minute sensor signals.
- Enables elimination of noise from an input signal
By operating as a filter of input signals, the operational amplifier circuit is able to extract the signal with the target frequency. For example, when an operational amplifier circuit is used for voice recognition or in a voice recorder, it can extract frequencies close to the targeted sound while shutting out all other frequencies as noise.
