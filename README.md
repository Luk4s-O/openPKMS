Welcome to my second brain. This is my sequential PKMS database.

openPKMS ruleset:

1. The only embedded non-markdown syntax allowed is TeX unless computer code is to be shown
2. Titles and notes themselves are lowercase by default
3. No foldering
4. Minimize note length. Each and every single idea is to have its own properly referenced note
5.
