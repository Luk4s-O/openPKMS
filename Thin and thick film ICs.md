In thin or thick film [[integrated circuit]]s, passive components such as [[resistor]]s, [[capacitor]]s are integrated but the [[diode]]s and [[transistor]]s are connected as separate components to form a single and a complete circuit. Thin and thick ICs that are produced commercially are merely the combination of integrated and discrete (separate) components.
