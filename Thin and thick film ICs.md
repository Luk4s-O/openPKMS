In thin or thick film [[integrated circuit]]s, passive components such as [[resistor]]s, [[capacitor]]s are integrated but the [[diode]]s and [[transistor]]s are connected as separate components to form a single and a complete circuit. Thin and thick ICs that are produced commercially are merely the combination of integrated and discrete (separate) components. Thick and thin ICs have similar characteristics, similar appearance except the method of film deposition. Method of deposition of films distinguished Thin ICs from Thick ICs.
