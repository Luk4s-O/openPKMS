stands for radio detection and ranging. by bouncing off of an object, a radar can detect travel time of the emitted wave (from and to the source), determining the distance, thus detecting and mapping out an object or a terrain.

a radar signal bouncing off a surface which is in [[motion]] relative to the radar device will cause a [[doppler effect ]] to occur, shifting the frequency of the wave, which the radar can detect, this
