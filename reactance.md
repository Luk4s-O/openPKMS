In [[electric circuit]]s, reactance is the opposition presented to alternating current by inductance or capacitance. Greater reactance gives smaller current for the same applied voltage. Reactance is similar to [[resistance]] in this respect, but differs in that reactance does not lead to dissipation of electrical [[energy]] as [[heat]]. Instead, energy is momentarily stored in the reactance, and a quarter-cycle later returned to the circuit, whereas a resistance continuously loses energy.
