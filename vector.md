Vectors have a direction within however many dimensions and a total magnitude.
$$
\overrightarrow{v} = (x, y, z)
$$
Based on the direction of the vector, we may separate its magnitude into components; vectors, which run parallel along their respective dimensions, and together add up to the original vector, all via the [[Pythagorean theorem]] and [[trigonometry]], using functions such as [[sine]], [[cosine]], or [[tangent]].
## Summing
In case of [[sum]]ming vectors together, components which have and identical direction can be simply added together:
$$
(x_1 , y_1)  + (x_2 , y_2) = (x_1 + x_2, y_1 + y_2)
$$
