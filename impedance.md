In electrical engineering, impedance is the opposition to [[alternating current]] presented by the combined effect of resistance and [[reactance]] in a [[electric circuit]]. Mathematical, impedance is a vector (two-dimensional)quantity consisting of two independent scalar (one-dimensional) phenomena: resistance and reactance.
