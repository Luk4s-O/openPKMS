The basic description of a [[henry]] is 1 [[volt]] induced for every 1-[[ampere]] change in the [[current]] through the coil per [[second]].

$$L=\frac{\Phi(I)}{I}$$

where 
$\phi(I) =$ [[magnetic flux]] of [[current]] $I$

Inductance is dependent on 
$$L = \frac{2NμA}{d}$$
where
- $N =$ number of turns of coil
- $μ =$ [[permeability]] of the core
- $A =$ area of cross section of the core
- $d =$ length of the core (in case of a non-[[magnetic core]] which is used to increase the [[magnetic field]] and thus the inductance)
