The elementary power rule generalizes considerably. The most general power rule is the functional power rule: for any functions $f$ and $g$
$$(f^g) = \left(e^{g\ln f}\right) = f^g\left(f{g \over f} + g\ln f\right)\quad$$
wherever both sides are well defined.

Special cases
* If $f(x)=x^a!$, then $f(x)=ax^{a-1}$ when $a$ is any non-zero real number and $x$ is positive.
* The reciprocal rule may be derived as the special case where $g(x)=-1!$.
