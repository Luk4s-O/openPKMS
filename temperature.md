Many physical processes are related to temperature, some of them are given below:

- the physical properties of materials including the [[phase]] (solid, liquid, gaseous or plasma), density, solubility, vapor pressure, electrical conductivity, hardness, wear resistance, thermal conductivity, corrosion resistance, strength
- the rate and extent to which chemical reactions occur
- the amount and properties of [[thermal radiation]] emitted from the surface of an object
- the [[speed of sound]], which in a gas is proportional to the square root of the absolute temperature
