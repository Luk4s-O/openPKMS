# Leibniz
the original notation employed by [[Gottfried Leibniz]] is used throughout mathematics. It is particularly common when the equation $y = f(x)$ is regarded as a functional relationship between $y$ and $x$ Leibniz's notation makes this relationship explicit by writing the derivative as $\frac{dy}{dx}\text{ or }\frac{d}{dx}y\text{ or }\frac{df}{dx}(x)\text{ or }\frac{d f(x)}{dx}\text{ or }\frac{d}{dx} f(x).$

Higher derivatives are written as:
$$\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}$$
as in,
$$\frac{d\left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)}{dx} = \left(\frac{d}{dx}\right)^2y = \frac{d^2y}{dx^2}$$

The value of the derivative of $y$ at a point $x=a$ may be expressed in two ways using Leibniz's notation:

$$\left.\frac{dy}{dx}\right|_{x=a} \text{ or } \frac{dy}{dx}(a)$$

Leibniz's notation allows one to specify the variable for differentiation (in the denominator). This is especially helpful when considering [[partial derivatives|partial derivative]].  It also makes the [[chain rule]] easy to remember and recognize:

$$\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du} \cdot \frac{du}{dx}$$

Leibniz's notation for differentiation does not require assigning a meaning to symbols such as $dx$ or $dy$ on their own, and some authors do not attempt to assign these symbols meaning.  Leibniz treated these symbols as [[infinitesimal|infinitesimals]].  Later authors have assigned them other meanings, such as infinitesimals in [[non-standard analysis]] or [[exterior derivative]]s.
