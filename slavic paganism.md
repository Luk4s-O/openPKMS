an polytheistic ethnoreligion attributed to [[slavs|slavic tribes]] in middle and eastern europe; a form of [[paganism]]. individual interpretations and forms of the religion vary by region, as paganism in general was part of an oral tradition with very limited written accounts. the [[pantheon]] is therefore not universally consistent, much like the tales of mythical creatures or various other stories.

# current state of slavic paganism
after the rise of the prominence of [[christianity]], the religion has lost most of its popularity, though it's modern form attempting the return to the original tradition is known as slavic neopaganism.

## Perun
Perun is the god of [[lightning]] and thunder, as well as of war, and the patron of the druzhina. He is the etymological and functional continuator of the Proto-Indo-European thunder god *Perk ∑unos*, and shares many characteristics with other thunder gods worshipped by Indo-Europeans. He is mentioned most notably in Primary Chronicle, where a grey-haired and golden-moustached statue of Perun is described in temple on Old Kyiv Hill, and Third Novogorod Chronicle, where his statue is described in Peryn,[8] and in many texts warning against paganism. His name survived in spells and in proper names. Armed usually with an axe, hammer, or spear, he fights chaos demons.
