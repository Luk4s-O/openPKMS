Both Codomain and Range are the notions of functions used in mathematics. While both are related to output, the difference between the two is quite subtle. The term “Range” sometimes is used to refer to [codomain].  When you distinguish between the two, then you can refer to codomain as the output the function is declared to produce. The term range, however, is ambiguous because it can be sometimes used exactly as Codomain is used. Let’s take _f_: A -> B, where _f_ is the function from A to B. Then, B is the codomain of the function “_f_” and range is the set of values that the function takes on, which is denoted by _f_ (A). Range can be equal to or less than codomain but cannot be greater than that.

For example, let $A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$ and $B = \{1, 4, 8, 16, 25, 64, 125\}$. The function _f_: A -> B is defined by $f(x) = x^3$. So here,

Domain = Set A

Codomain = Set B, and

Range (R) = {1, 8, 64, 125}

The range should be cube of set A, but cube of 3 (that is 27) is not present in the set B, so we have 3 in domain, but we don’t have 27 either in codomain or range. The range is the subset of the codomain.
