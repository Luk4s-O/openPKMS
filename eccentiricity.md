In mathematics, the eccentricity of a [[conic section]] is a non-negative real [[number]] that uniquely characterizes its shape. More formally two [[conic section]]s are similar if and only if they have the same eccentricity. One can think of the eccentricity as a measure of how much a [[conic section]] deviates from being circular.

|[[conic section]]|eccentricity, e|semi-major axis|energy|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
|circle|0|= radius|< 0|
|ellipse|0 < e < 1|> 0|< 0|
|parabola|1|infinity|0|
|hyperbola|> 1|< 0|> 0|
