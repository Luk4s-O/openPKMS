In monolithic [[integrated circuit|IC]]s, the discrete components, the active and the passive and also the interconnections between then are formed on a silicon chip. The word monolithic is actually derived from two Greek words “mono” meaning one or single and Lithos meaning stone. Thus monolithic circuit is a circuit that is built into a single crystal.Monolithic ICs. Types of ICs

Monolithic ICs are the most common types ICs in use today. Its cost of production is cheap and is reliable. Commercially manufactured ICs are used as amplifiers, voltage regulators, in AM receivers, and in computer circuits. However, despite all these advantages and vast fields of application of monolithic ICs, it has limitations. The insulation between the components of monolithic ICs is poor. It also have low power rating, fabrication of insulators is not that possible and so many other factors.
