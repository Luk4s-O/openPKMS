1 Nm = 10 cables = 1852 meters - measure of distance
1 min. = 60 sec. - measure of angle
1 knot = 1 Nm/hour - measure of speed

Due to the scaling of the projection, the horizontal scale is different than the vertical one - use the y axis to determine a distance in Nm after measuring a distance with a compass. One large piece on the map is 1 Nm.

Every Nm is also a minute on the y-axis - 1 cable = 6 seconds

Longitude - horizontal position
