Differential signalling is a method for electrically transmitting information using two complementary signals. The technique sends the same electrical signal as a differential pair of signals, each in its own conductor. The pair of conductors can be wires in a twisted-pair or ribbon cable or traces on a printed circuit board.

For example, a differential input device, such as an [[op-amp]], tends to use 2 input pins, one with reference voltage, and another with measured voltage, comparing he two.
