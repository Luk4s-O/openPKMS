# a derivative of a function gives us another function which determines the slope of the orignal function
## Differentiation is linear
For any functions $f$ and $g$ and any real numbers $a$ and $b$, the derivative of the function $h(x) = af(x) + bg(x)$ with respect to $x$ is: $h'(x) = a f'(x) + b g'(x)$

===Logarithmic derivatives===

The [[logarithmic derivative]] is another way of stating the rule for differentiating the [[logarithm]] of a function (using the chain rule):
:$ (\ln f)= \frac{f}{f} \quad$ wherever {{Mvar|f}} is positive.

[[Logarithmic differentiation]] is a technique which uses logarithms and its differentiation rules to simplify certain expressions before actually applying the derivative.{{cn|date=October 2021}}

Logarithms can be used to remove exponents, convert products into sums, and convert division into subtraction â€” each of which may lead to a simplified expression for taking derivatives.

General Leibniz rule
{{main|General Leibniz rule}}
If {{Mvar|f}} and {{Mvar|g}} are {{Mvar|n}}-times differentiable, then

$$ \frac{d^n}{dx^n}[f(x)g(x)] = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} \frac{d^{n-k}}{d x^{n-k}} f(x) \frac{d^k}{d x^{k} g(x)}$$
