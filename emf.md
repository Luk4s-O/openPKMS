short for electromotive force, often denoted by $\mathcal{E}$. is the electrical action produced by a non-electrical source, measured in volts. Devices called electrical [[transducer]]s provide an emf by converting other forms of [[energy]] into electrical energy, such as batteries (which convert chemical energy) or generators (which convert mechanical energy).

Counter-electromotive force (also called back emf) is the electromotive force manifesting as a voltage that opposes the change in current which induced it. Back emf is the emf caused by electromagnetic induction.
