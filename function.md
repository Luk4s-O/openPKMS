A function relates each element of a [[set]] with exactly one element of another set  
(possibly the same set). The set of possible inputs into a function is called a [[domain]], the set of possible outputs is a [[codomain]]. The actual detected outputs are defined as a [[range]]. It is important to note that the [[difference between codomain and range|codomain and range are not the same thing]].
