inductor, also known as a coil, is a passive unit of an [[electric circuit]] representing [[induction]] in an [[electric circuit]]. An inductor can come to be unintentionally, causing unwanted [[impedance]], or it can be introduced to a circuit intentionally. The three common uses of an inductor include:

- Creating an [[electromagnetic field]] dependent on the [[current]]
	- This field can also serve for compact energy storage, which is the most common use for [[SMD]] inductors
- Creating an [[induction]] via an [[electromagnetic field]]
- For transforming the [[voltage]] in a [[transformer]]
The numeral characteristic describing an inductor is its [[inductance]], the unit of which is the [[henry]].
