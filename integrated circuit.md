is a set of electronic circuits on one small flat piece (or "chip") of semiconductor material, usually silicon. Large numbers of tiny [[MOSFET]]s (metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistors) integrate into a small chip. This results in circuits that are orders of magnitude smaller, faster, and less expensive than those constructed of discrete electronic components. The IC's mass production capability, reliability, and building-block approach to integrated circuit design has ensured the rapid adoption of standardized ICs in place of designs using discrete transistors. ICs are now used in virtually all electronic equipment and have revolutionized the world of electronics. Computers, mobile phones and other home appliances are now inextricable parts of the structure of modern societies, made possible by the small size and low cost of ICs such as modern computer processors and microcontrollers.

ICs can be categorized in many ways.
Below is the classification of different types of ICs basis on their chip size.

SSI: Small scale integration. 3 – 30 gates per chip.
MSI: Medium scale integration. 30 – 300 gates per chip.
LSI: Large scale integration. 300 – 3,000 gates per chip.
VLSI: Very large scale integration. More than 3,000 gates per chip.
Types of ICs (Integrated Circuits)
Based on the method or techniques used in manufacturing them, types of ICs can be divided into three classes:

Thin and thick film ICs
Monolithic ICs
Hybrid or multichip ICs
Below is the simple explanation of different types of ICs as mentioned above.

Thin and Thick ICs:
In thin or thick film ICs, passive components such as resistors, capacitors are integrated but the diodes and transistors are connected as separate components to form a single and a complete circuit. Thin and thick ICs that are produced commercially are merely the combination of integrated and discrete (separate) components.
