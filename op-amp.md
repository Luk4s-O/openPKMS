An operational amplifier or op-amp is simply a [[linear Integrated Circuit]] (IC) having multiple-terminals. It is a high-gain electronic voltage amplifier with a [[differential signalling|differential input]] and usually a single-ended output. Op-amps are among the most widely used electronic devices today as they are used in a vast array of consumer, industrial and scientific devices. Its basic role is to amplify and output the [[voltage]] difference between the two input pins - hence, it is operating under the umbrella of [[differential signalling]].

There are several [[op-amp parameters]]/terms which need to be understood in op-amp applications:
