There are several [[op-amp]] parameters/terms which need to be understood in its applications:
-   **Input offset voltage:** It is the voltage that must be applied between the input terminals of an op-amp to nullify the output.
-   **Input offset current:** It is the algebraic difference between the currents into the (-) input (the inverting input) and (+) input (the non-inverting input).
-   **Input bias current:** It is the average of the currents entering into the (-) input and (+) input terminals of an op-amp.
-   **Input resistance:** It is the differential input resistance as seen at either of the input terminals with the other terminal connected to ground.
-   **Input capacitance:** It is the equivalent capacitance that can be measured at either of the input terminal with the other terminal connected to ground.
-   **Slew rate:** It is defined as the maximum rate of change of output voltage caused by a step input voltage. The slew rate improves with higher closed loop gain and DC supply voltage. It is also a function to temperature and generally decreases with an increase in temperature.
