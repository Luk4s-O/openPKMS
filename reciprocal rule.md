The derivative of $$h(x)=\frac{1}{f(x)}$$for any (nonvanishing) function $f$ is:

$$h(x) = -\frac{f(x)}{(f(x))^2}$$wherever $f$ is non-zero.

In [[Leibniz notation]], this is written

$$ \frac{d(\frac{1}{f})}{dx} = -\frac{1}{f^2}\frac{df}{dx}$$
The reciprocal rule can be derived either from the [[quotient rule]], or from the combination of [[power rule]] and [[chain rule]].
