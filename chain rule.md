The derivative of the function $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is
$$h(x) = f(g(x))\cdot g(x)$$

In the[[Leibniz derivative notation]], this is written as:
$$\frac{d}{dx}h(x) = \left.\frac{d}{dz}f(z)\right|_{z=g(x)}\cdot \frac{d}{dx}g(x)$$
often abridged to
$$\frac{dh(x)}{dx} = \frac{df(g(x))}{dg(x)} \cdot \frac{dg(x)}{dx}$$
