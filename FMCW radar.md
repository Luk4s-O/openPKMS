FMCW radar (**F**requency-**M**odulated **C**ontinuous **W**ave radar = **FMCW radar**) is a special type of [[radar]] sensor which radiates continuous transmission power like a simple continuous wave radar ([[CW-Radar]]). In contrast to this CW radar FMCW radar can change its operating frequency during the measurement: that is, the transmission signal is modulated in frequency (or in phase). Possibilities of Radar measurements ​​through runtime measurements are only technically possible with these changes in the frequency (or phase).
