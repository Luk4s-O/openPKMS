a type of [[electric circuit]] involving [[semiconductor]]s. if the circuit is in a compact purpose-built package, we call it an [[integrated circuit]].

[[analog circuit]]s and [[digital circuit]]s are the two main types of electronic circuits. The key [[difference between analog and digital circuits]] is that an analog circuit can process only analog signals, while a digital circuit can process digital signals.
